# Pasqal Banish Fix for Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader

## What it does
This mod is for if you are getting the conversation with Zi-Ra in Act 2 where they are speaking about Pasqal being banished, even though he is not, and therefore locking you out of Nomos.
This mod will remove the Zi-Ra conversation in Act 2, so the Pasqal conversation triggers instead.
You will want to load a save before the conversation took place (mine was happening after beating the dark eldar on your capital planet) and you can safely remove this mod afterwards.


## Install
This is a UUM mod so it needs to be manually installed into your `%localappdata%low\Owlcat Games\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\UnityModManager`
