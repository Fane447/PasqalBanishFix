# Pasqal Banish Fix for Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader

## What it does
This mod is for if you are getting the conversation with Zi-Ra in Act 2 where they are speaking about Pasqal being banished, even though he is not, and therefore locking you out of Nomos.

This mod will remove the Zi-Ra conversation in Act 2, so the Pasqal conversation triggers instead.

You will want to load a save before the conversation took place (mine was happening after beating the dark eldar on your capital planet) and you can safely remove this mod afterwards.

Example of the conversation with Zi-Ra, which mentions exiled Pasqal.
